This sample app demonstrates a SplitView, the one known from iPad that appears when orientation is in landscape.

BEWARE:

This is an early alpha version of the SplitView. The contained framework is based on the 'splitview' branch
and does not contain all updates. This sample app exists to demonstrate what will be in the master branch in the future.
